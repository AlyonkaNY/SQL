# SQL

Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. Since a great amount of data is stored in relational databases, retrieving data using SQL queries is often the first step in any data analysis project.
